About the program:
WATVina was optimized for drug design. It was developped based on the Autodock Vina 1.12(http://vina.scripps.edu).
The conformation searching is combined simplified genetic algorithm (SGA/BFGS) for the start steps, then goes to simulated annealing(SA/BFGS).
The c++ source code will be opened after deep optimization, so advice is welcome for improving WATVina.
