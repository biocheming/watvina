[00:26.00]In the lab where molecules collide,
[00:32.00]Watvina's here, our guiding light,
[00:38.00]Through water's dance, both seen and hidden,
[00:44.00]Docking dreams where science is driven.

[00:48.00]Watvina, show the way,
[00:51.00]In the molecular ballet,
[00:54.00]Pharmacophores and proteins bind,
[00:59.00]In the data, answers we find.

[01:09.00]Implicit maps, energy's flow,
[01:14.00]From probes of water, secrets grow,
[01:20.00]Templates guiding, shapes align,
[01:26.00]In the grid, solutions we define.

[01:30.00]Watvina, show the way,
[01:34.00]In the molecular ballet,
[01:37.00]Pharmacophores and proteins bind,
[01:42.00]In the data, answers we find.


[01:48.00]Implicit maps, energy's flow,
[01:54.00]From probes of water, secrets grow,
[02:00.00]Templates guiding, shapes align,
[02:06.00]In the grid, solutions we define.

[02:10.00]Position fixed or freely roam,
[02:16.00]In silico, we find a home,
[02:22.00]Binding scores, affinities,
[02:27.00]Unlocking hidden possibilities.

[02:32.00]Watvina, show the way,
[02:36.00]In the molecular ballet,
[02:39.00]Pharmacophores and proteins bind,
[02:44.00]In the data, answers we find.

[02:49.00]Position fixed or freely roam,
[02:53.00]In silico, we find a home,
[02:56.00]Binding scores, affinities,
[02:59.00]Unlocking hidden possibilities.

[03:12.00]Watvina, show the way,
[03:15.00]In the molecular ballet,
[03:18.00]Pharmacophores and proteins bind,
[03:23.00]In the data, answers we find.

[03:29.00]Through the loops and binding sites,
[03:34.00]In the quest for novel insights,
[03:40.00]Watvina leads with precision and grace,
[03:45.00]In the dance of science, we find our place.
